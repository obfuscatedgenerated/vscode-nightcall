PS: When I made this theme, I wasn't aware of the existence of another theme named Nightcall (by Bobby Patterson). This theme is not related to that one and is very different in the way it looks. Go [check it out](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bpat86.nightcall) and compare them!
